# Task List Application

The **Task List Application** is a simple, modern to-do list web app designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. This app allows users to add, mark as completed, delete, and store tasks persistently using local storage.

## Features

### Core Functionality:
1. **Add New Tasks**:  
   - Users can input tasks in the text field and add them to the list using the "Add" button.
   
2. **Mark as Completed**:  
   - Clicking on a task toggles its "completed" status, visually indicated by a strikethrough and background color change.

3. **Delete Tasks**:  
   - Users can remove tasks by clicking the "×" button next to the task.

4. **Persistent Storage**:  
   - Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage and remain available after a refresh or browser restart. This ensures that users don't lose their tasks when they leave and come back to the app.

## How It Works
Adding Tasks:
Users can type tasks into the input box and click the "Add" button to add them to the list. This will also trigger an update to the local storage, ensuring that tasks are saved even after a page refresh.

Marking Tasks as Completed:
Clicking on a task will toggle its completion status, making it appear crossed out. This visual feedback helps users keep track of what they have already completed.

Deleting Tasks:
Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking the "×" button next to each task. The task is then deleted both visually and from local storage.

Persistent Data:
The tasks are stored in local storage so that even after the browser is closed and reopened, the task list will remain intact.

## How to Use
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Add tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking "Add".
Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
Delete tasks by clicking the "×" next to them.
The tasks will be saved automatically and will persist after page reloads.
